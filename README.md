## üöÄ Introduction

Similar to Meissonic, Monetico is a non-autoregressive masked image modeling text-to-image synthesis model capable of generating high-resolution images. It is designed to run efficiently on consumer-grade graphics cards.

Monetico is an efficient reproduction of Meissonic. Trained on 8 H100 GPUs for approximately one week, Monetico can generate high-quality 512x512 images that are comparable to those produced by Meissonic and SDXL.

Monetico was developed by Collov Labs. We extend our gratitude to @MeissonFlow and @viiika for their valuable advice on efficient training.
